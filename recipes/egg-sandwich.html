<p><strong>Lasagna</strong> is the name of one of the oldest and best-known pasta shapes.
     It is usually rectangular or ribbon shaped, thicker than tagliatelle, made from a dough based on flour and eggs, with numerous local variants.</p>

<p>Making lasagna can be time-consuming, but the results are well worth the wait.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Meat</strong>: This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean ground beef.</li>
    <li><strong>Onion and garlic</strong>: An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.</li>
    <li><strong>Tomato products</strong>: You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.</li>
    <li><strong>Sugar</strong>: Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.</li>
    <li><strong>Spices and seasonings</strong>: This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.</li>
    <li><strong>Lasagna noodles</strong>: Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.</li>
    <li><strong>Cheeses</strong>: Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.</li>
    <li><strong>Egg</strong>: An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it.</li>
